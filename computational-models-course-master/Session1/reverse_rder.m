% Exercise 7. 

    % Write a MATLAB function called reverse_order.m that takes a vector
    % as its input, and returns the vector in reverse as its output. Use this
    % function to create a variable called myReverseFourteenTimesTable

                % A vector is a 1-dimensional array of numbers.
                % It can be row vector or column vector.

function reverse.order = (inputvector) 

myReverseFourteenTimesTable = reverse_order(myFourteenTimesTable); % myFourteenTimesTable is a vector
